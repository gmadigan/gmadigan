## 👋🏻 Welcome!

### ⏱ Quick about me

* 🇺🇸 From the CA Bay Area, currently on the US East Coast
* 👨🏻‍💻 Machine Learning Engineer at Entefy Inc. - designing, building, and deploying bespoke ML models for enterprise clients
* 👨🏻‍🎓 PhD in physics, 5 years at CERN searching for new particles with the LHC (world's highest energy particle accelerator)
* 🐍 10 years of Python expertise developing data pipelines and performing statistical analysis on TB of data
* 📖 Co-authored a [peer-reviewed paper](https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.112003) covering a search I led for exotic new physics with the CMS collaboration at CERN's LHC

### 🤖 What I am building

Here is my [portfolio](https://gmadigan.github.io/) showcasing past and current projects. I have hands-on development experience with:

* Generative AI: RAG, LLMs
* Deep learning: NNs, RNNs, LSTM, CNNs, encoder-decoders
* Traditional machine learning: NLP, SVMs, BDTs (gradient boost, XGBoost), classification, regression
* Fine-tuning: QLoRa, grid/random search

### 🛠 My favorite tools

These are the languages, libraries, and tools I reach for when I start exploring data.

* Languages: Python, SQL, C++
* Machine Learning: PyTorch, Hugging Face, Langchain, SentenceTransformers, Unsloth, Scikit-learn, Keras, spaCy, Gensim, Ray Tune, TorchMetrics
* Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks
