## 👋🏻 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi, I'm Gabriel. A data scientist and former CERN particle physicist. My expertise is in extracting weak signals in large, noisy data by building custom ML models in python.

### ⏱ Quick about me

* 👨🏻‍🎓 PhD in physics with 5 years at CERN searching for new particles in data from the LHC (world's highest energy acceleratior)
* 🐍 10 years of Python development + collaboration via GitHub
* 🤖 5 years training, testing, and applying machine learning models to extract weak signals in noisy data
* 📖 Co-authored a [peer-reviewed paper](https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.112003) searching for new physics with the CMS detector at CERN

### 🔭 What I am building
